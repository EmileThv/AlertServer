This is a small school project written in Java. It sets up an alert notification server using Java and Object Oriented Programming. 
The goal was to experiment using OOP, not APIs, thus the "notification" part is written by prints. 
Requires the java.util.map package.
For further details, read the javaDoc, it is quite extensive.
